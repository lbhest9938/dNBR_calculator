#final project for python
##this project is also designed for python 3.6
##first we must install git, bash, and anaconda to local computer
##after those are installed we need to install earth-analytics-python environment

#** means that we are missing a step here and need to figure it out

##this program does the following in this order

##1. opens pre fire landsat data and calculates the NBR of prefire

##2. opens post fire data and calculates NBR of postfire

##3. calculates dNBR using simple rater functions

##4. classifies fire damage using certain value ranges in dNBR

##5. calculates areas of no burn, low, moderate, and high fire damage.

##6. generates color map of dNBR

##7. plots these classes in a graph
